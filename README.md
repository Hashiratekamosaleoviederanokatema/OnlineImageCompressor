## 📝 What is Online Image Compressor?
Online Image Compressor is my personal project made in HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) and JS using library to compress images. It was made to be simple without any bloat. Just download or visit website, set after compression maximum image size (not even required), choose your image to compress, press that juicy blue button and voilà!

## 📚 TODO
**Things to do:**
- add support for compressing multiple images with one click
